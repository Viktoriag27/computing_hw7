This project sets up a FastAPI server that serves a machine learning model. The API allows you to send JSON data and get predictions from the trained model.

## Requirements

To get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- `uvicorn` (ASGI server for running FastAPI)
- `FastAPI` (web framework)
- `joblib` (for loading the machine learning model)
- `requests` (for making HTTP requests to the API)

You can install all the necessary dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
